TODO
----
* Add sounds (use the sounds from Snake in Space?)
* Add a proper pause menu
* Add scoreboard (online?)
* Add background (parallaxscrolling for the win!)
* Improved menuscreen
* Let playeys type in name and choose color of snake
* Add Ouya monetizing (mohahaha!)
* When the game is played with hard walls, the snake should bounce like this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/573206
